2. Check relative path to reference added in project is correct.
3. Should be "packages\NUnit...."

## Assembly reference relative paths for project and solution in different folders

## View and install packages from a NuGet feeds requiring basic and Windows authentication

1. Open Manage Packages dialog and try to view packages from a feed requiring authentication.
2. Check that an error is shown on Linux and Mac.
3. Use custom NuGet.exe build to add credentials for authenticated feed.

          mono --runtime=v4.0.30319 NuGet.exe sources update  -name FeedName -username user -password pass

4. Open Manage Packages dialog and view packages from authenticated feed.
5. Packages can be viewed and installed from authenticated feed.

## app.config and web.config Transforms

1. Install a package with an app.config.transform into a console project.
2. Check the app.config is updated with the transform.
3. Install a package (e.g. Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet) with an web.config.transform into a web project.
4. Check the web.config is updated with the transform.

Known issue with case sensitivity of .config filenames.

## XML Document Transforms (XDTs)

1. Install a package with an app.config.install.xdt into a web project.
3. Check the web.config is updated with the transform.

## PCLs

1. Install Json.NET into a PCL project that targets Profile 104.
2. Check that the portable version of Json.NET is referenced.
3. Install a NuGet package (e.g. Antlr3.Runtime.PCL) with only a PCL assembly into a normal .NET 4 project.
